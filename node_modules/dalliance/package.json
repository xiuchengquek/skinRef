  "readme": "Biodalliance: fast, embeddable genome visualization\n=========================\n\nDalliance is a genome viewing tool that aims to offer a high\nlevel of interactivity while working entirely within your web\nbrowser. It works with current versions of Chrome, Firefox, and\nSafari and (with minor visual glitches) Internet Explorer 11.  It\nis also usable with current mobile web browsers.\n\nTo try it, visit [http://www.biodalliance.org/human37.html](http://www.biodalliance.org/human37.html).\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nDalliance has now switched to a [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)-based build\nsystem.  It it still possible to use the files in the js directory\ndirectly, but this is now deprecated and may not be supported in future.\n\nBefore building, please install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), which\nis needed for the NPM package manager.\n\nTo build:\n\n        (sudo?) npm install -g gulp\n        npm install # Install dependencies\n        gulp        # Build Dalliance\n\n...then open any of the HTML files in the `example-browsers` directory\nto test.\n\nAdding extra data\n-----------------\n\nDalliance loads data via the [DAS](http://biodas.org/) protocol.\nThere's a button to click that will let you add DAS sources.  If what\nyou're after is in the registry, you should just be able to select and\nadd, otherwise you'll need to type a URL.\n\nYou can also add data directly from indexed binary files (currently\nbigwig, bigbed and BAM, probably other formats in the future).  Binary files\ncan either be hosted on a web server or loaded from local disk.\n\nHowever, there is one caveat.  Since Dalliance is a pure Javascript\nprogram running in your web browser, it is normally subject to the\n\"same origin policy\", which only permits Javascript code to access\nresources on the same server.  To get round this, DAS servers need to\nsupport the W3C [CORS](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) extension.  The\nlatest versions of Dazzle, Proserver and MyDAS should implement this by\ndefault.\n\nReporting bugs\n--------------\n\nDalliance is under active development and we welcome your suggestions.\nRight now, probably the best place for bug reports or feature requests\nis the [Github issue tracker](http://github.com/dasmoth/dalliance).\n\nThere is also a [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/biodalliance-dev)\nwhere the project can be discussed.\n",
